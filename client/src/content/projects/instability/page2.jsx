      <h1>Fluid Instabilities</h1>

      <p>In fluid dynamics, an instability occurs when the interface between two fluids is disrupted while the fluids are under acceleration or shear.</p>

            <h2>The Rayleigh-Taylor Instability</h2>
            <p>Occurs when a <b>less</b>-dense fluid is accelerated into a <b>more</b>-dense fluid.</p>
            <p>Here on earth, this is easily visible when water (more-dense) is placed over oil (less-dense). Gravity creates a buoyancy force which pushes the oil upward into the water, causing the two to mix.</p>
            <p>This process is visible in 2D on the right, or in 3D on the previous page. Pause, rotate, and zoom the figure to really explore the differences.</p>

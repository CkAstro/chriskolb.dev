            <h2>The Create Items Tool</h2>
            <p>The create items tool is located in the Toolbar. It is shown to the right and consists of 5 buttons.</p>
            <p>From left to right, clicking these buttons creates: a constant-value isosurface, a spherical slice, a constant-Z plane, a constant-Y plane, and a constant-X plane.</p>

            <h2>The Item Controller</h2>
            <p>Once a slice is created, it will appear in the item controller, located at the bottom of the Toolbar.</p>
            <p>On the top bar is the item name, viewport visibility, and the delete button. Clicking the visibility options will toggle the display. Clicking the delete button will remove the item.</p>
            <p>Both the item name and the slider values are editable via double-click.</p>
            <p>The slidebars allow you to change how the item is displayed. For the isosurface, you can change the value (range 0 to 1). For the constant-value planes, you can change the axis value (range -1 to 1). For the sphere, you can change both the radius (range 0 to 1) and the center ,coordinates.</p>
            <p> The "Variable" option allows you to change via drop-down which variable is displayed.</p>

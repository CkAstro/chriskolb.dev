      <h1>The Math Behind Wind - Isothermal Parker Wind</h1>

      <p>The solar corona is a supersonic wind heated to 10<Tex2SVG display='inline' latex='^6'/> degrees Kelvin which expands out to about twice the Earth-Sun distance in all directions. This constant-temperature (isothermal) wind was first described by Eugene Parker as what is now known as a <a href='http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Parker_Wind' target='_blank'>Parker wind</a>. The derivation is as follows:</p>

      <p>Conservation of mass tells us</p>

      <Tex2SVG latex='\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot(\rho \vec{u}) = 0'/>

      <p>and conservation of momentum is</p>

      <Tex2SVG latex='\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\rho \vec{u}) + \nabla \cdot (\rho \vec{u}\vec{u}) + \nabla P = \vec{f},'/>

      <p>where <Tex2SVG display='inline' latex='\vec{f}'/> is some external force per unit mass. We will assume the star emits a spherically symmetric wind, so these equations will only depend on radius. If we take this momentum equation and write it in spherical coordinates, it becomes</p>

      <Tex2SVG latex='u\frac{\partial u}{\partial r} + \frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial P}{\partial r} = -\frac{GM}{r^2},'/>

      <p>where the last term is the force of gravity acting on the wind. Writing the mass equation in spherical coordinates gives</p>

      <Tex2SVG latex='\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^2\rho u\right) = 0.'/>

      <p>Here, we can ignore the <Tex2SVG display='inline' latex='1/r'/> term and we see the derivative inside the parenthesis is equal to zero, meaning its integral is a constant. We will choose <Tex2SVG display='inline' latex='\dot{M}'/> for this constant, which is the mass-per-unit time carried by the wind, or the mass-loss rate of the star.</p>

      <Tex2SVG latex='\dot{M} = 4\pi r^2 \rho u'/>

      <p>We may rewrite this in a more useful form for later:</p>
   
      <Tex2SVG latex='\rho(r, u) = \frac{\dot{M}}{4\pi r^2 u}.'/>

      <p>Finally, we can express the pressure in terms of the sound speed, <Tex2SVG display='inline' latex='c_s'/>. The gas is adiabatic, so</p>
      
      <Tex2SVG latex='P = c_s^2 \rho.'/>

      <p>Now, we can work on the <Tex2SVG display='inline' latex='\partial P/\partial r'/> term. As we see above, we do not know pressure in terms of radius, so we must apply the chain rule as follows.</p>

      <Tex2SVG latex='\frac{\partial P}{\partial r} = \frac{\partial P}{\partial \rho}\left[\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial r} + \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial u}\frac{\partial u}{\partial r}\right]'/>

      <p>The first term in the brackets is found using <Tex2SVG display='inline' latex='\rho(r, u)'/>, and is given by</p>

      <Tex2SVG latex='\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial r} = -\frac{2\dot{M}}{4\pi r^3 u} = -\frac{2 \rho}{r},'/>

      <p>where we have replaced the <Tex2SVG display='inline' latex='\dot{M}'/> term with our expression for <Tex2SVG display='inline' latex='\rho'/>. We don't have a solution for <Tex2SVG display='inline' latex='\partial u/\partial r'/> either, but that is actually what we're trying to solve for. The other expression in the second term is</p>

      <Tex2SVG latex='\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial u} = -\frac{\dot{M}}{4\pi r^2 u^2} = -\frac{\rho}{u}.'/>

      <p>For the final term, we use <Tex2SVG display='inline' latex='P = c_s^2\rho'/> to show</p>

      <Tex2SVG latex='\frac{\partial P}{\partial \rho} = c_s^2.'/>

      <p>Combining all these gives</p>

      <Tex2SVG latex='\frac{\partial P}{\partial r} = -c_s^2\left[\frac{2\rho}{r} + \frac{\rho}{u}\right],'/>

      <p>and the full expression is</p>

      <Tex2SVG latex='u\frac{\partial u}{\partial r} - \frac{2c_s^2}{r} - \frac{c_s^2}{u} = -\frac{GM}{r^2}.'/>

      <p>With a little re-aranging, we can show</p>

      <Tex2SVG latex='\frac{1}{u}\frac{\partial u}{\partial r}(u^2 - c_s^2) = \frac{2c_s^2}{r} - \frac{GM}{r^2}.'/>

      <p>This result is known as the Parker wind solution. The first thing we should notice about this is the left-hand side becomes zero when <Tex2SVG display='inline' latex='u = c_s'/>. This is known as a 'critical velocity', where the wind transitions to or from supersonic speed (where it travels faster than it's own speed of sound). When this term is zero, either the right-hand side must be zero or <Tex2SVG display='inline' latex='\partial u/\partial r'/> must be infinite. We can set the right-hand side to zero to show</p>

      <Tex2SVG latex='\frac{2c_s^2}{r} = \frac{GM}{r^2} \to r = \frac{GM}{2c_s^2}.'/>

      <p>This value of <Tex2SVG display='inline' latex='r'/> is a critical radius, and we see the wind cannot transition to supersonic speeds anywhere but this radius. Defining the critical radius as <Tex2SVG display='inline' latex='r_c'/>, the above Parker equation may be integrated to show</p>

      <Tex2SVG latex='\left(\frac{u}{c_s}\right)^2 - \log\left(\frac{u}{c_s}\right)^2 = 4\log\left(\frac{r}{r_c}\right) + 4\frac{r_c}{r} + C,'/>

      <p>where <Tex2SVG display='inline' latex='C'/> is a constant. If we look at the case where <Tex2SVG display='inline' latex='u=c_s'/> and <Tex2SVG display='inline' latex='r=r_c'/>, we see <Tex2SVG display='inline' latex='C = -3'/>.</p>
